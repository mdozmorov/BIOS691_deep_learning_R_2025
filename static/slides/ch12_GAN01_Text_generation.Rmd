## Generative adversarial networks (GANs)

> The most important [recent development], in my opinion, is adversarial training (also called GAN for Generative Adversarial Networks). This is an idea that was originally proposed by Ian Goodfellow when he was a student with Yoshua Bengio at the University of Montreal (he since moved to Google Brain and recently to OpenAI).

> This, and the variations that are now being proposed, is the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in ML, in my opinion.

## Sequence data generation

*   The universal method for generating sequence data in deep learning involves **training a model** (typically a **Transformer or an RNN**) to **predict the next token or the next few tokens in a sequence**.

*   The model uses the **previous tokens as input** for this prediction. For example, given "the cat is on the," the model is trained to predict "mat".

*   Tokens are usually **words or characters**, especially when dealing with text data.

---
## Sequence data generation

*   A network capable of modeling the probability of the next token given the preceding ones is called a **language model**.

*   A language model **captures the latent space of language** and its **statistical structure**.

*   Once a language model is trained, you can **sample from it to generate new sequences**.

*   This involves **feeding the model an initial string of text** (known as **conditioning data**).

---
## Sequence data generation

*   The model is then asked to **generate the next character or word** (or even several tokens at once).

*   The **generated output is added back to the input data**, and this process is **repeated multiple times**.

*   This iterative loop allows for the generation of sequences of **arbitrary length** that reflect the **structure of the training data**, often resembling human-written sentences.

## Sequence data generation

The **sampling strategy** for choosing the next token is crucial.

*   A naive approach is **greedy sampling**, where the most likely next character is always chosen, but this often leads to repetitive and predictable strings.

*   A more interesting method is **stochastic sampling**, which introduces randomness by sampling from the probability distribution for the next character.

## Sequence Data Generation: Controlling Randomness with Temperature

A parameter called the **softmax temperature** can be used to control the amount of stochasticity (randomness) in the sampling process.

Let $z_i$ be the probability for token $i$. The temperature-scaled softmax is computed as:

$$P(i) = \frac{e^{z_i / T}}{\sum_j e^{z_j / T}}$$

where $T$ is the **temperature** parameter. $T = 1$ gives the standard softmax, $T < 1$ sharpens the distribution (less randomness), $T > 1$ flattens the distribution (more randomness).

## Sequence Data Generation: Controlling Randomness with Temperature

*   **Higher temperatures** lead to more surprising and unstructured generated data due to sampling from distributions with higher entropy.
    *   **Makes the model more likely to sample less probable words.** This leads to more surprising, diverse, and potentially creative output.
    *   However, **very high temperatures can lead to generated text that loses coherence and appears largely random**.

*   **Lower temperatures** result in less randomness and more predictable generated data from distributions with lower entropy.
    *   **Makes the model more likely to stick to the most probable next words.** This can lead to more repetitive, and sometimes boring text.
    *   **Very low temperatures can lead to the model getting stuck in loops**.

## LSTMs as Generative Networks

- LSTMs trained on collections of text can be run to generate text - predict the next token(s) given previous tokens.

- LSTMs are better for structured, sequential tasks, e.g., text; GANs excel in image synthesis.

- **Text/Code Generation:** Story writing, chatbot responses, AI-assisted programming.
- **Music Generation:** Composing melodies, generating polyphonic music.
- **Image Captioning:** Generating textual descriptions from images.

## A brief history of generative deep learning for sequence generation

*   The **LSTM algorithm**, which enabled successful sequence data generation with recurrent networks, was developed in **1997**.

*   Early on, the LSTM algorithm was used to **generate text character by character**.

*   In **2002**, **Douglas Eck** applied **LSTM to music generation** for the first time, showing promising results.

## A brief history of generative deep learning for sequence generation

*   In the late 2000s and early 2010s, **Alex Graves** did important pioneering work using recurrent networks for sequence data generation, notably his **2013 work on generating human-like handwriting** using recurrent mixture density networks.

*   Between **2015 and 2017**, recurrent neural networks were successfully used for various generative tasks including **text and dialogue generation, music generation, and speech synthesis**.

## A brief history of generative deep learning for sequence generation

*   Around **2017–2018**, the **Transformer architecture** began to replace recurrent neural networks for generative sequence models, particularly for **language modeling (word-level text generation)**.  

*   A well-known example of a generative Transformer is **GPT-3**, a large language model trained by OpenAI, which gained attention in **2020** for its ability to generate plausible-sounding text on almost any topic.  

*   **GPT-4 (2023, OpenAI)** – An improved version of GPT-3, demonstrating stronger reasoning, factual accuracy, and multimodal capabilities (accepting text and image inputs).

## Latest Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs)

*   **Gemini 1.5 (2024, Google DeepMind)** – A multimodal LLM with **longer context memory** (up to 1 million tokens), significantly improving code and document understanding.  

*   **Claude 3 (2024, Anthropic)** – Focused on safety and interpretability, Claude 3 exhibits near-GPT-4 performance while being more efficient.  

*   **Mistral & Mixtral (2023, Mistral AI)** – Open-weight LLMs with **efficient mixture-of-experts (MoE)** architectures, balancing accuracy and inference speed.  

*   **Llama 3 (2024, Meta AI)** – The next generation of Meta’s **open-source** language models, designed for improved efficiency and multilingual support.

## A Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model

*   We will train a model to **predict a probability distribution over the next word in a sentence**, given a number of initial words.

*   The model takes as **input a sequence of N words** (indexed from 1 to N).

*   The model aims to **predict the sequence offset by one** (from 2 to N+1).

*   We employ **causal masking** to ensure that when predicting the word at position `i + 1`, the model only uses words from position 1 to `i`.
    *   This allows the model to be trained to solve **N mostly overlapping but different problems**: predicting the next word given a sequence of 1 to N prior words.
    *   This also enables the model to **start predicting with fewer than N words** at generation time.
