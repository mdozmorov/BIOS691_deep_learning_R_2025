## Input Embedding and positional encoding

- **Word embedding** - words are tokenized, passed to an embedding layer which is a trainable vector embedding space - a high-dimension space where each token is represented as a vector and occupies a unique location in that space. These embedding vectors learn to the encode the meaning and context of individual tokens in the sentence.

- **Positional encoding** adds a sequence of predefined vectors to the embedding vectors of the words. This creates a unique vector for every sentence, and sentences with the same words in different order will be assigned different vectors (think "I'm happy, not sad" and "I'm sad, not happy").
$$PE(pos, 2i) = \sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})$$
$$PE(pos, 2i+1) = \cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})$$
- pos - the position/order of the word in the sentence, i - index in the embedding vector, d_model - embedding length



---
## Self-Attention Mechanism

- **Self-attention**, also known as **intra-attention**, is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the same sequence.

- The model learns which words are **related** to each other and how much **context** each word needs to interpret the current word. 

- This process is inspired by how humans pay attention ‚Äì we selectively focus on important parts of information while filtering out the rest.

---
## Self-Attention Mechanism

1. **Each word (token) looks at every other word** in the sentence.  

2. It **scores the relevance** of each word to itself (embedding similarity).  

3. The words that are **more relevant (similar) get higher attention** scores.   

4. The output is a **weighted combination of all words,** with important ones contributing more to the final representation.  

---
## Self-Attention Mechanism

Relevance of a word to the target word = the dot product between two word embedding vectors (plus a scaling function and a softmax).

---
## Self-Attention Mechanism

Compute the sum of all word vectors, weighted by our relevance scores - words closely related to the target word will contribute more.

.center[<img src="img/transformers_self_attention_11_6.png" height=450>]

---
## Key, Value and Query

- The transformer views the encoded representation of the input as a set of key-value pairs, $(K,V)$, both of dimension $n$ (input sequence length). 

- The transformer adopts the scaled dot-product attention: the output is a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is determined by the dot-product of the query with all the keys:
  - Compute attention scores by comparing Q and K.  
  - Use scores to weigh V.  


$$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V$$
  - $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vector.  

---
## **Q, K, and V intuition**  

1. **Query (Q):** Represents **what we are searching for.** *Your search request ‚Äì "Find books on climate change."*

2. **Key (K):** Represents **the information available.** Think of it as **"What does each word offer to the query?"**  *Each book's title and description.*  

3. **Value (V):**  Represents **the actual content** associated with each key.  *The actual contents of each book.*  

If a book‚Äôs title and description match your query, you‚Äôll read its content. This process mirrors how transformers use self-attention to prioritize relevant words.  

---
## **Q, K, V numerical representation**  

1. **Input:**  A sentence of length **N** (number of words/tokens). Each word is embedded into a vector of size **d_model** (e.g., 512 or 768). Example: A 10-word sentence, with each word embedded as a 512-dimensional vector ‚Üí $dim(X) = 10 \times 512$  

2. Q, K, and V are obtained by **multiplying the input by three weight matrices learned by three network layers**. Each matrix projects the input into **different subspaces** but maintains the same shape.   
   $$Q = XW_Q, \quad K = XW_K, \quad V = XW_V$$
   - $X$ is the input tensor $N \times d_{model}$, $W_Q, W_K, W_V$ are weight matrices $d_{model} \times d_k$. $d_k$ is the dimension of Q, K, V (often $d_k = d_{model} / h$, where $h$ is the number of attention heads). **Shape of Q, K, V:** $N \times d_k$

## Positional encoding need

- Positional encoding is used to **add information about the position of words in a sequence** to their embedding vectors. 

- This is crucial for models like the Transformer, which, by themselves, process sequence tokens independently and are **order agnostic**.

*   Transformers operate on the entire sequence at once, they **don't inherently know the order of the words**, and positional encoding provides this missing piece of information.

---
## Positional encoding idea

*   The fundamental concept is to **augment each word embedding with a vector that represents the word's position** within the sequence.

*   **Different Approaches:**
    *   A simple initial idea might be to concatenate the word's position (e.g., 0 for the first word, 1 for the second) to its embedding vector. However, this is **not ideal** because the position values can become large and disrupt the embedding values.
    *   The original Transformer paper employed a more intricate method using **cyclical cosine functions** to create position vectors with values in the range [-1, 1].
    *   A simpler and often more effective technique is **positional embedding**. This involves **learning position embedding vectors** in a similar way to how word embeddings are learned.

---
## Positional encoding implementation

*   A separate **embedding layer** (`layer_embedding()`) is created specifically for the **positions** of the tokens in the sequence.

*   The input to this embedding layer is a sequence of **position indices** (e.g., `[0, 1, 2, ...]`) corresponding to the words in the input sequence.

*   The output of this position embedding layer is a sequence of **position embedding vectors**, one for each position.

*   These **position embedding vectors are then added element-wise to the corresponding word embedding vectors**. The result is a set of **position-aware word embeddings** that are fed into the Transformer encoder or decoder.

---
## Positional encoding implementation

*   When using learned positional embeddings, the **maximum sequence length** that the model can handle needs to be **defined in advance** because a separate embedding is learned for each position up to that length.

*   **Outcome:** By adding positional encoding, the Transformer model gains the ability to **differentiate between words based on their location in the input sequence**, enabling it to understand the order and relationships between words effectively.

## Multi-Head Attention

- Multiple sets (or heads) of self-attention are learnt in parallel. The number of attention heads vary from model to model, but numbers may range to the order of 12 ‚Äì 100.

- Captures **different types of relationships** in parallel. For example, one head might see the relationship between people, another head may focus on the context of the sentence and another head may see relationship between nouns and the numerical values and another the rhyming between the words (or tokens) and so on.

## Multi-Head Attention

According to the paper, "_multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this._"

1. Split input into **multiple heads**.  

2. Perform self-attention on each head.  

3. Concatenate and pass through dense layers.

## Full Architecture

- Both the source and target sequences first go through embedding layers to produce data of the same dimension $d_{model}=512$.

- To preserve the position information, a sinusoid-wave-based positional encoding is applied and summed with the embedding output.

- A softmax and linear layer are added to the final decoder output.

| Name                   | Alignment Score Function | Citation |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------|
| **Content-base attention** | $\text{score}(s_t, h_i) = \cos(s_t, h_i)$ | [Graves2014] |
| **Additive(*)**        | $\text{score}(s_t, h_i) = v_a^T \tanh(W_a [s_{t-1}; h_i])$ | [Bahdanau2015] |
| **Location-Base**      | $\alpha_{t,i} = \text{softmax}(W_a s_t)$ <br> *Note: This simplifies the softmax alignment to only depend on the target position.* | [Luong2015] |
| **General**           | $\text{score}(s_t, h_i) = s_t^T W_a h_i$ <br> *where* $W_a$ *is a trainable weight matrix in the attention layer.* | [Luong2015] |
| **Dot-Product**       | $\text{score}(s_t, h_i) = s_t^T h_i$ | [Luong2015] |
| **Scaled Dot-Product(^)** | $\text{score}(s_t, h_i) = \frac{s_t^T h_i}{\sqrt{n}}$ <br> *Note: very similar to the dot-product attention except for a scaling factor; where* $n$ *is the dimension of the source hidden state.* | [Vaswani2017] |
(*) Referred to as "concat" in Luong, et al., 2015 and as "additive attention" in Vaswani, et al., 2017.  
(^) It adds a scaling factor $1/\sqrt{n}$, motivated by the concern when the input is large, the softmax function may have an extremely small gradient, hard for efficient learning.

## Transformers for tabular data

- **TabPFN** - the _Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network_, a tabular foundational model (generative transformer-based), outperforms other models, excels on small datasets, scalable, fast. Classification or regression problems. Leverages in-context learning (ICL), generates a large corpus of synthetic tabular datasets (prior in Bayesian terms, approach based on structural causal models, SCMs) and then train a self-attention-based transformer neural network. Pre-training - predict masked targets of all synthetic datasets. Z-normalization of inputs. Sample-specific learning, feature-specific attention attending to features across samples, invariant to the order of samples and features. Tested on two benchmark datasets, AutoML benchmark and OpenML-CTR23, outperforms XGBoost, CatBoost, random forest. Approaches for interpretation. Python implementation. https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn-client
