    - **Dot product** - the Dot product of two vectors returns a scalar value.
    - **Cross product** - the Cross product of two vectors returns another vector which is orthogonal (right-angled) to both.

.center[<img src="img/vector_dot_cross_product.png" height=350>]

---
## Matrices and Matrix Operations

- **Scalar Multiplication** - multiply all matrix elements with the scalar.
- **Matrix Multiplication** - multiplying two matrices means calculating the dot product of the rows and columns and creating a new matrix with dimensions derived from the two input matrices.
- **Hadamard product** - element-wise product of the two vectors ( $\bigodot$ ).
- **Transpose of the matrix** - swap the rows and the columns in a matrix.
- **Inverse to the matrix** - an inverse of a matrix multiplied with the matrix gives an identity matrix.

## Tensors

Tensors are a generalization of vectors and matrices to an arbitrary number of dimensions.

- A tensor that contains only one number is called a scalar (or scalar-tensor, or zero-dimensional tensor, or 0D tensor).

- A one-dimensional array of numbers is called a vector, or 1D tensor.

- A two-dimensional array of numbers is a matrix, or 2D tensor.

- An array of matrices makes a three-dimensional array of numbers, or 3D tensor.

---
## Tensors

A tensor is defined by three key attributes:

- **Number of axes (rank)** - For instance, a 3D tensor has three axes, and a matrix has two axes.

- **Shape** - This is an integer vector that describes how many dimensions the tensor has along each axis. A vector has a shape with a single element, such as (5). Think `dim()` function.

- **Data type** - This is the type of the data contained in the tensor; integer or double.

---
## Real-world tensors

- **Vector data** - 2D tensors of shape (samples, features).

- **Timeseries data or sequence data** - 3D tensors of shape (samples, timesteps, features).

- **Images** - 4D tensors of shape (samples, height, width, channels).

- **Video** - 5D tensors of shape (samples, frames, height, width, channels).

## Calculus for Deep Learning

- **Derivatives** - derivatives measure the change in the output value when we change the input value.
- **Partial derivatives** - Partial derivative is when we consider only one variable, keep all the other variables as constant, and take the derivative with respect to the considered variable.
- **Chain rule** - helps when input variables are expressed as functions of other functions. If $y = f(u)$ and $u=g(x)$ are both differentiable, then $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du}\frac{du}{dx}$
- **Gradient** - the gradient of the function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ (an $n$-dimensional vector $[x_,x_2,...,x_n]^T$) is a vector of $n$ partial derivatives $\nabla_x f(x) = \left[\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_2},...,\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x_n} \right]^T$

.small[https://d2l.ai/chapter_preliminaries/calculus.html]

---
## Supervised Learning

- **Supervised Learning** - using training data (input variables) with the known target variable, find rules that give the relationship between the input and the target variables. These rules can then be applied to the unseen (test) data to predict the expected target variables for it. Examples: kNN, SVM, Linear Regression, etc.
    - **Regression** - predict numeric (continuous) outcome.
    - **Classification** - predict continuous (binary or multinomial) outcome.

- **Applications** - Text categorization, Face Detection, Signature recognition, Customer recommendation system, Spam detection, Weather forecasting, Predicting housing prices based on the prevailing market price, Stock price predictions, among others.

.small[https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/04/supervised-learning-unsupervised-learning/]

---
## Unsupervised Learning

- **Unsupervised Learning** - the target variable is unknown, so the goal is to cluster the data into groups, and we can identify the groups after we have clustered the data. Examples of unsupervised learning include k-means clustering, dimensionality reduction techniques, etc.
    - **Clustering** - organize unlabelled data into _similar_ groups.
    - **Anomaly detection** - identify rare events.

- **Applications** - Fraud detection, Malware detection, Identification of human errors during data entry, Conducting accurate basket analysis, etc.

.small[https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/04/supervised-learning-unsupervised-learning/]

---
## Semi-supervised learning

- Learning guided by the data itself.

- Labels generated from the input data.

- **Autoencoders** - learns data properties (labels) to reconstruct input data.

- The distinction from other learning types is not well-defined.

---
## Reinforcement Learning

- **Reinforcement Learning** - learning to make specific decisions based on past experience. An agent interacts with an environment over time, receives feedback as reward or punishment, and adjusts its action policy to maximize the reward for the next action.
    - 2015: Google's Deep Q algorithm wins Atari games.
    - 2015: Google's AlphaGo algorithm beats best human Go players.

---
## Data preprocessing

- **Vectorization** - sample-specific data should be represented as a vector. The vector representation scheme should be consistent from sample to sample.

- **Normalization** - Make values small, typically within the 0-1 range. Make them homogeneous, relatively uniformly distributed throughout the range
    - In general, it isn’t safe to feed into a neural network data that takes relatively large values or data that are on different scales. Doing so can trigger large gradient updates that will prevent the network from converging.
    - Normalize **features** to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
    - Important: Normalize training data separately, then use these normalization constants to normalize validation and test sets.

---
## Training-test-validation sets

- **Training set** - data used to develop feature sets, train our algorithms, tune hyperparameters, compare models, and all of the other activities required to choose a final model.
- **Test set** - data used to estimate the final model’s performance.
- 70%/30% split is typical to separate the initial dataset into training and test sets.
.center[<img src="img/overunderfitting.png" height=350>]

---
## Training-test-validation sets

- During training, some data leakage occurs - the model memorizes some properties of the test set that improve performance. Leads to overfitting.
- **Validation** - data used to improve the model. Needed to evaluate the model on never-before-seen data, to make the model generalizable and prevent overfitting.
- 60%/20%/20% is typical to split the data into three sets.
.center[<img src="img/overunderfitting.png" height=350>]

---
## Training Epochs & Model Performance

* **Training epoch** is one complete pass through the entire training dataset, where the model processes each sample once and updates its weights to minimize the loss function.

* **Loss function** measures how far the model's predictions deviate from actual values. Lower loss generally indicates better model performance, but extremely low training loss may signal overfitting.

* **Learning rate** controls how much a model adjusts its parameters during each training step.

* **Model performance** is tracked across epochs - initially, both training and validation loss decrease as the model learns. When validation loss starts increasing while training loss continues to decrease, this indicates overfitting has begun.


---
## Machine/deep learning lifecycle

**Learning curves** plot training and validation metrics (loss, accuracy) against epochs, helping visualize model convergence and identify overfitting.

.center[<img src="img/overunderfitting2.png" height=300>]
* **Early stopping** is a technique that halts training when validation metrics stop improving, preventing overfitting.

---
## Cross-validation

- **Cross-validation** - A common machine learning strategy wherein the dataset is split multiple times into training and validation sets. The average validation performance across the multiple splits is used to select the final model.

- k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, bootstrapping.

## Bias variance trade-off

- **Bias** - the difference between the expected (or average) prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict.
- **Variance** - the variability of a model prediction for a given data point.

## Underfitting and Overfitting

- **Underfitting and Overfitting** - too simple or too complex models.

## The central goal of machine learning - data transformation

The "learning" part of machine learning is to find useful representations of the input data that get us closer to easily detect the expected output.

.center[<img src="img/ML_data_transformation.png" height=200>]

The new coordinates are the new representation of the data making it easy to classify it. 

---
## The central goal of machine learning - data transformation

Layers in a deep neural networks are well-suited for finding useful data representations. They do input-to-target mapping via a deep sequence of simple data transformations that are learned by exposure to examples.

.center[<img src="img/layers.png" height=300>]
.small[ https://blog.gopenai.com/decoding-the-architecture-determining-layers-and-neurons-in-deep-neural-networks-dnns-c2ac349989c2 ]

---
## Weights and biases

- The specification of what a layer does to its input data is stored in the layer's **weights**. Weights are parameters of a layer.
- **Bias** allows a layer to better fit the data. Think intercept in linear regression that ensures better fit as compared with forcing the regression line through zero.

## How to think about deep learning

- The most surprising thing about deep learning is how simple it is.

- All you need is sufficiently large parametric models trained with gradient descent on sufficiently many examples.

- Each layer in a deep-learning model operates one simple geometric transformation on the data that goes through it.

- A key characteristic of this geometric transformation is that it must be differentiable, which is required in order for us to be able to learn its parameters via gradient descent. Intuitively, this means the geometric morphing from inputs to outputs must be smooth and continuous.

- As Richard Feynman once said about the universe, "It’s not complicated, it’s just a lot of it".
