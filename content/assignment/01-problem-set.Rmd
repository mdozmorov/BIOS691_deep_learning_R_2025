- Follow installation instructions in [installation_code.R](slides/code/installation_code.R). Note we are installing the [keras3](https://keras3.posit.co/) package.
- Download [01-main-ingredients_code.Rmd](slides/code/01-main-ingredients_code.Rmd). Modified from [dl-keras-tf](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/dl-keras-tf).
- Download [images.zip](slides/code/images.zip). Extract the `images` folder in the same directory as the `01-main-ingredients_code.Rmd` file.
- Read and run the code in the `01-main-ingredients_code.Rmd` file. Consult ChatGPT in case of errors.
- Answer questions in the code chunks currently set to `eval=FALSE`.
- Knit the document into an HTML format and submit the knitted document.
